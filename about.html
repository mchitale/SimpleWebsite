	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>My name is Maitreyi and I am a tech enthusiast. I currently work as an engineer in the Engineering Development Group at MathWorks. In this role, I have worked on development projects with the Computer Vision team, the Deep Learning team, and the MATLAB Performance team. My core programming language competencies lie in C++, Python, and MATLAB. </p>
	<p>Before joining MathWorks, I was a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. I pursued a combination of Deep Learning and Systems graduating with a Master's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. </p>
	<p>I also have another website that looks fancier than this and is located <a href="https://www.maitreyichitale.com">here</a>.</p>
